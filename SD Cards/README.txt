The contents of the firmware update microSD card and the customization microSD
card are contained within the "Firmware" and "Customization" folders
respectively. 

ONLY THE CONTENTS OF THESE FOLDERS SHOULD BE SAVED TO THE microSD CARDS!
The folders themselves SHOULD NOT be placed on the card. The contents of these
folders, as they appear, should be placed in the root directory of the card.
